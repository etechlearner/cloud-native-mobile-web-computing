# Introduction to Cloud Native Computing

## Monolithic Computing

    Traditional way of computing called monolithic Architecture
    when we start Cloud native computing, let's look at what was heppening as a traditainal way of computing.
    Monolithic is defined in single line (very large,united design and diffecult to change problem)
  - composed all in one piece
  - self-contained 
  - tightly-coupled 
  - redeploy entire application on each update
  - slow down the start-up time
  - if bug in any module its bring down the entire process
  - its barrier to adopting new technologies and dependancy updated versions
  - application change become extremely expensive in both time and cost
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Microservices - also known as the microservice architecture
    In this architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are. Highly maintainable and testable. Loosely coupled. Independently deployable. Organized around business capabilities.
   
   ### Microservices do have distinct advantages:
   #### Better Organization:
   - Microservice Architectures are typically better organized.
   - Each microservice has a very specific job, and it is not concerned with the jobs of other components.
   #### Decoupled:
   - Decoupled service are also easire to change, update and re-configure to serve te purposes of defferent apps.
   - They also allow for fast, independent delivery of individual parts within a larger, intergrated system.
   #### Performance:
   - Under the right circumstances, microserives can also have performance advantages depending on how they're origanized.
   - it's possible to isolate hot services and scale them independently of the rest of the app

## What is Cloud? 

```
The word "cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world
```
```
In single line cloud can be describe as a "communications network".
```
```
A Cloud can be a wide area network (WAN) linke the public Internet or a private, national or global network. The term can also refer to a local area network (LAN) within an origanization.
```
   ### Type of Cloud:
   #### Private CLoud:
   - Deploying cloud computing internally.
   - Private cloud employs cloud computing with a company's own local or wide area networks
   #### Public CLoud:
   - A cloud computing service on the internet that is available to the general public
   - Commercial cloud providers like Amazon, Google Cloud, Azure etc
   #### Hybrid CLoud:
   - The user of both private and public clouds to provide an organization's computing needs
